5 mins, use report (https://github.com/ExtraSlowCode/ClimateStation/blob/main/README.md) as presentation slides.

Objective
- Simplicity
- temperature comarison
- lightsensor
- humidity
- room monitoring

Material
- Starter kit
- RPI Pico, DHT11 prev experience
- Photoresistor fun
- improvements: on-board temp, leds, mcp9700
- limit costs

Thonny
- simple interface, no requirements for complication

Hardware:
- Board image
- Wiring diagram
- Plan for efficient soldering

How the photoresistor was offset
- 10k to have a load slightly higher than max (7k)
- tweak for offset

Code
- Show class diagram
- 15 min upload rate
- callstack

Results
- dashboard (https://app.datacake.de/pd/d020b65c-bb35-4199-a751-88c524848a5a)
- Happy with functionality, but would have liked a case, and soldered hardware. But no time, funds for duplicate components
